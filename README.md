# Hi welcome to the DiscordMiniGame page !

## Find Word

### Rules:
Each player will be given a sequence of 2 to 3 letters, and will have to find a word in the dictionnary that contains this sequence. If you don't find a word in time, the bomb explodes, reset the timer and ask a word to the next player.
