## Setup

I am currently using python 3.8.1 to run this bot, but it may work for older version aswell. 

You'll also need to install [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html)

Then simply run bot.py 

Windows:

    python3 bot.py

Linux:

    $ chmod a+x bot.py
    $ ./bot.py
